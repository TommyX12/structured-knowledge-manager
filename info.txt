@ see time manager note for more stuff
!!! check out relational data model for what to do. SQL?


!!! unify terminologies like topics vs nodes

a standalone command-line based tool:
!!! integrate with vim, and make CLI intuitive and fast to use, extracting and saving etc.
// !!! prompt for setpath when old path becomes invalid (not a dir)
has a modifiable data base.
stores nodes in a graph.
automatic backup system.
standardized query output format for use in gui tools
you write a file that gets compiled into database (automatic linking).
    default append, and will not overwrite.

allow easy re-organization
    can merge two nodes (or add link to content in another node)

https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle might be useful for database.
or use python's pickle module

!!! data structure:
    !!! relational reference and prereq reference are different!
    do not expose too many stuff in the Topic class.
    store reference of database in topic
    use a bunch of functions in Database class to modify the whole connection
    any modification that requires modifying one or more property of one or more topics (without knowing the other topic), should be in database class.
    methods that add connection should be in topic so you can create a sub network and then add
    database provide functionality for fuzzy search etc.
    parser interfaces with database, and provide functionality for displaying fuzzy search result etc and choose to add topic etc.
    !!! allow inline link like html, each link remember the line numbers where it is left off. that line contains its own indentation and the link will add to it when extracting.
        if a connection has line index -1, then it is always prepended to the content, and all later index add one.

when compiling:
    note that top level topics are automatically under the root node (with name = empty string).
        ? root node cannot have connection and content
        root node cannot be deleted
        therefore you should always use - as token
        
    ask for all topic names in the document and show top 10 searches.
        can specify some "using" namespace at the top so the searches are easier.
        allow local search that restricts namespace.
        !!! do not allow adding connection that already exists.
        local entries use local search.
        skip entries that are exact match.
        ? skip entries that are local but have no match and just add.
        show context
        also allow adding as new entry. then the path name gets its own search, then append the final topic name.
            ? maybe during the process can ask for names
            this applies to any topic with any token (connection, child etc). so you can specify creation of a prereq by << asdf.
            
        also allow re-typing the name and search again.
        search each part of a full namespace separately.
        !!! able to connect to a topic that is declared later.
        able to find missing link (e.g. a::b::c but wrote a::c)
        able to use alias for each part
        prioritize to topics in current file (or when choosing a name, do we update all other reference to that topic in the file)
            and topics similar to topics in current file
            
        prioritize parents that are related to stuff in current file.
        prioritize nodes with shorter full path name
        also show the number of characters the content has.
    
    remember to remove the trailing : for a topic name.
        or maybe : means there must be content below, otherwise it is just a link?
        
    also add ability to abort.
    also detect if two nodes have very similar names and ask if you want to auto correct.
    warn when appending to existing nodes. tell user to check for disambiguation.
    
    ? duplicated reference: refering to both A::B and B. should we delete one?

? maybe different type of links. some links are hidden, etc.

able to escape with a \ at start of line so no special options is performed

!!! update lpp.vim syntax highlighting to suit this

can strength the database by adding more connection.

? automatic connection for stuff that are siblings but might have each other as prereq?
!!! handling prereq, and cyclic reference detection

use - for local reference: parent child relationship.
use > and < for relational reference 
    !!! note that relational reference and prereq reference are different!
    
use >> and << for prereq reference
use << (empty) for prereq reference to topic defined right above (sibling).
maybe allow multiple type of connection on one line like >> > or ><

use -- for local reference but starting from current parent. ---, ----, etc go further up. and will by default put a relational reference for it, can specify with -- >> etc.

an interactive mode that can do queries such as view the graph structure like a file system.
    can fuzzy search the database.
    view content, parent, children of any node.
    query siblings, limited BFS propagation from node, explore topics, etc.
    
    ? record all query output to a file so editor can copy paste the stuffs

repurpose @: @ command, which executes command when interpreted. this usually modifies the topic that the commands are in.
    @ rename [new name]
        renames the topic to the new name.
        ? all rename commands are executed first? so then all other places use the new name.
        ? also rename all topics that has this in its namespace path
        !!! do not allow renaming a node to inside of itself
        
    @ id [id]
        link this node to an id, so can move the node around
    
    @ overwrite
        mark the topic as having its content overwritten by whats written here.
    
    @ delete
        delete the topic. also delete all topics that are children (namespace tree), unless '@ delete self', then simply remove from part of children full name.
    
    @ alias [alias]
        add alias of this topic, useful when searching.
        
    @ file [file path]
    @ web [url]
        link to file or online resources

? allow rich content such as ms-word
    maybe contain file links that link to some files.
    this then do not support latex compiling, unless its an includable latex file.

can embed latex code.
    can also embed other code.

given a starting node, can extract out the parts you want to modify into a file (copying content from database), then you change and compile it back. (for example, generate something called MAT137 notes).
    default overwrite.
    use BFS
    can specify max traversal depth
    can specify to include backward connections
    when max traversal depth is reached, no longer mark overwrite, and omit content
    for cyclic / duplicated reference, simply do not mark overwrite for the second referral, and omit content.
        or make special rules that use DFS instead of BFS to determine which goes first.
        can specify the indentation. default 4 spaces
        
? use garbage collection reference model. label some nodes to be persistent, and some are not. any node that has not been set persistent will be destroyed when it has no parent.
    or just simply make top level nodes so as to organize things. force every-node to either connect to top level by some means, or be top level.

given a starting node, can generate latex document.
    or can generate many latex document and contain link that links.
    ? how to specify which copy of topic (when multiple occurs) to include and which to omit?

name matching shrinks word boundary, so "computer :: stack (memory segment)" is same as "computer    ::stack(memory    segment)"

actually manage the ? and !!! and @.

can also generate a bunch of files such that the entire database can be built from the ground up using only these files. can choose what to include, etc.

order of outgoing links within a node is preserved.

use graph algorithms, prefix-tree, etc.

also supports SQL style queries.
the modification file uses lpp note syntax and indent.
    if something is indented, this indicates a parent-child connection.
    can also have special macro that add a parent or remove a parent.
    ? maybe add a special type of link called pre-requisite links. what should those do and whats the difference between parent child relationship?
    renaming of nodes. maybe use an ID system.

local / enum nodes has only 1 parent, and will not have name clashing (local name-space). query use special search.
    - asdfasdfasd and 1. 2. etc
    can refer to as > python :: syntax.
    the restriction is that each segment between :: will need to be actual nodes.
    ? can use .. to refer to parent.
    ? what if you remove connection from the parent to a local child?
    ? how to perform reorganization such that you can move a lot of local child to a new one to structure things?
        simply embed an id to the old thing.
    
    the idea of aggregation
    
    // ? do we introduce a command that refers to the old content of a node, so you can safely move them and maintain that?
    // also, local links are automatic, meaning a :: b will always have a linked to b, even if not explicitly specified.

maybe even integrate machine learning clustering to re-organize.

maybe a namespace system similar to C#.
    specify file namespace (using) with :: music etc at top level lines.
    also specify such that all new nodes created are prepended with a namespace.

? adding a parent to a node with <:

!!! maybe build a GUI that is easy to use.

!!! after this is kinda operational, move my knowledges into it. make sure to regularly backup.

? maybe able to get a random line that has ? in front of it.

? maybe able to share online for collaboration?

optimization:
    use lazy loading and not load the entire database?
    design more efficient parsing etc.
    use custom made ID instead of id()
